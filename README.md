## Customer Segmentation and marketing campaigns analysis

### Project Overview 

What motivated me to carryout an analysis on marketing campaigns and customer segmentation is that they are an essential component of 
how businesses promote their interests. It is therefore critical for companies to measure customer engagement with marketing campaigns,
evaluate the effectiveness of previous efforts, and suggest data-driven strategies to boost engagement with upcoming campaigns.
The data used in the project is taken from kaggle.

- `datetime` for date manipulation.
- `pandas` to perform data manipulation and analysis.
- `seaborn` for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
